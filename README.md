# Django-TODO-List-App
In this project, I created a TODO list web application using the Django web framework integrating a database that will store all the to-do items. Each to-do item has a title, description, status and deadline. The to-do list web application also has user registration, login, search and full CRUD functionalities. We use a class-based view to handle the CRUD operations in the to-do list project.
