# Django-TODO-List-App
In this project I created a TODO list web application using Django web framework integrating a database that will store all the to-do items. Each todo item has a title, description, status and deadline. The to-do list web application also has a user regisration, login, search and a full CRUD functionalities. In the to-do list project we leverage the use of class-based view to handle the CRUD operations.
